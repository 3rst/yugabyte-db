## What is pg_stat_monitor?
The pg_stat_monitor is the statistics collection tool based on PostgreSQL's contrib module ``pg_stat_statements``. PostgreSQLâ€™s pg_stat_statements provides the basic statistics, which is sometimes not enough. The major shortcoming in pg_stat_statements is that it accumulates all the queries and their statistics and does not provide aggregated statistics nor histogram information. In this case, a user needs to calculate the aggregate which is quite expensive. ``pg_stat_monitor`` is developed on the basis of pg_stat_statements as its more advanced replacement. It provides all the features of pg_stat_statements plus its own feature set.

make USE_PGXS=1

make USE_PGXS=1 install
```

**Installing from rpm/deb packages**

``pg_stat_monitor`` is supplied as part of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. The rpm/deb packages are available from Percona repositories. Refer to [Percona Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/installing.html) for installation instructions.


## Setup

``pg_stat_monitor`` cannot be installed in your running PostgreSQL instance. It should be set in the ``postgresql.conf`` file.

```
# - Shared Library Preloading -

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor' # (change requires restart)
#local_preload_libraries = ''
#session_preload_libraries = ''
```

Or you can do from `psql` terminal using the ``alter system`` command.

``pg_stat_monitor`` needs to be loaded at the start time. This requires adding the  ``pg_stat_monitor`` extension for the ``shared_preload_libraries`` parameter and restart the PostgreSQL instance.

```
postgres=# alter system set shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_monitor;
ALTER SYSTEM

sudo systemctl restart postgresql-11
```


Create the extension using the ``create extension`` command.

```sql
postgres=# create extension pg_stat_monitor;
CREATE EXTENSION
```
