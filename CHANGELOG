0.3.0
-- Added grants configuration table to propagate permissions to newly created child partitions. Will also apply those permissions to the parent table and all existing child tables whenever a new partition is created. Permissions are only granted, never revoked. See docs for more info.


0.2.0
-- New functions to manage dropping old partitions. Does not actually need to be called directly unless necessary. Use run_maintenance() function.
-- Added ability to run_maintenance() function to manage dropping old tables in addition to managing time-based partitioning.
-- Removed raise notice in run_maintenance and make sure old search path is reset after function finishes running.
-- Lot of documentation updates


0.1.2
-- Added support for quarterly time partitioning (trickier than it first appeared)
-- Fixed bug in run_maintenance() that would give an invalid cast to integer error.
-- Fixed some calls to pg_jobmon that were outside the checks to see if it's actually installed
-- Properly reset search path back to original before partman functions were run if pg_jobmon is being used
-- Changed the default premake to 4 instead of 3. This will cause pg_jobmon's default monitoring for 3 consecutive failing jobs to trigger an before the last premade partition is used up.
-- Added optional jobmon logging to run_maintenance() so that if it fails, pg_jobmon can notify that maintenance didn't work.


0.1.1
-- Only re-create partition functions if a new partition is made.
